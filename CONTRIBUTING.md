Help us share faces!   
If you want to help expand our face selection, go to [www.disapprovallook.com](http://www.disapprovallook.com). Here you can find
all the LoD faces you may desire. Copy their **text** representation and create a new entry in the `faces.js` file following the following *JSON* schema:   
```javascript
IDENTIFIER: {
  name: "Identifier",
  face: "(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞", //text representation of the face
  thumb: "http://i.dsplk.com/j/something.jpg"
}
```

You can find thumbnails by going to http://www.disapprovallook.com/?cat=16.

### THANK YOU, ANY HELP IS MUCH APPRECIATED! :D
